# TS-Console-Employee-Manager

This project is an employee managing system that uses the mySQL workbench to handle an sql schema containing a database of information regarding employees, roles, and departments.

The application is run through console by turning the schema into a database with mySQL Workbench, then simply entering "npm start". The application will then prompt the user to view the current (optionally prebuilt by seeds) database, and make any necessary additions by adding a new employee, department, or role.
